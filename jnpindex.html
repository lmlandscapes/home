<p><u>Necessary for the performance of contract</u></p><br />

<p><u>Legitimate business interests or those of a third party</u></p><br />
<p>If your interests, rights and freedoms are not overridden by our legitimate interests (which on balance, we consider to be true) then we may collect and use your data to:</p>
<ul>

<h3>4. Who we share personal information with and where they store it</h3><br />
<p>We may provide your personal data to:</p>
<ul>
<li>our suppliers, services providers and sub-contractors including other companies in our group, who perform certain business services for us and act as “processors” of your personal data;</li>
<li>advertising networks that require the data to select and serve relevant adverts to you and others;</li>
<li>analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our landing pages; and</li>
<li>where applicable, to debt collection agencies for the purpose of collecting any monies due to us arising from a contract with you.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we may disclose your personal data:</p>
<ul>
<li>if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal or compliance obligation, or in order to protect the rights, property or safety of our business, our customers or others. This includes, in specific cases, exchanging information with other organisations for the purposes of fraud protection; and</li>
<li>to successors in title or replacement operators of all or part of our business.</li>
</ul>
<p>We collaborate with third parties such as cloud hosting services, suppliers, and technology support located around the world to serve the needs of our business, workforce, and customers. The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, processed at a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). The areas in which these recipients are located will vary from time to time, but may include the United States, and other countries where Get Work may, from time to time, use contractors. When we transfer personal information from the EEA to other countries in which applicable laws do not offer the same level of data privacy protection as in the UK, we take measures to provide an appropriate level of data protection. In other words, your rights and protections remain with your data. For example, we ensure that our suppliers and contractors comply with UK and EU data protection laws and use contractual clauses and other measures designed to ensure that the recipients of your personal information protect it.</p>

Our data protection policies and procedures and practices are in line with widely used European standards and are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to meet our business needs, changes in technology, and regulatory requirements.</p>
<span data-dismiss='modal' class='terms-close'>[Close]</span>

<a id='pp6'></a>
<h3>6. How long we keep your personal information for</h3><br />
<p>We retain your personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purpose(s) for which it was provided. This time period will vary between different types of data.</p><br />
<p>When determining the relevant retention periods, we take into account the following factors among others:</p>
<ul>
<li>legal obligation(s) under applicable law to retain data for a certain period of time;</li>
<li>statute of limitations under applicable law;</li>
<li>potential or actual disputes; and</li>
<li>guidelines issued by relevant data protection authorities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, we securely erase your personal data from our systems when it is no longer needed.</p>

<li>Have your personal data corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete.</li>
<li>In certain circumstances you may have the right to be forgotten (i.e. to have your personally identifiable data deleted). In many cases we would recommend that we remove or restrict you from future communications, rather than delete your data;</li>

<h3>10. What are cookies?</h3><br />
<p>A cookie is a small data file that is placed onto your computer or mobile device to automatically collect information about how a landing page, website or application is used; they help remember who you are and information about your visit.

Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Get Work) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website, landing page and/or application owner are called “third party cookies”.</p>
<p>Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or landing page (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics).
